<h1>About LaRuta</h1>
<p>With over 15 years of experience teaching English, Spanish, and Portuguese, and as a Japanese language learner myself, I realized I had all the tools necessary to help students study remotely.
</p>

<p>Having lived abroad, I understand firsthand the challenges and stakes involved in communicating effectively. Whether it’s expressing ideas clearly or overcoming language barriers, I’ve been there. My time in Japan, where I developed a basic vocabulary and mastered essential language structures, taught me invaluable lessons. <br /> Similarly, living in Brazil for nearly four decades, I’ve come to appreciate the complexities of Portuguese pronunciation.
  Since my teenage years, when I struggled to communicate without unintentionally making people laugh, I’ve understood the importance of mastering the fundamental sounds of any language you set out to learn.
